    <header><h1>About Josh Horton</h1></header>

<p>My dad showed me the game of <mark>golf</mark> at age five and I was hooked ever
since. It's a great way to unwind for me and provides an amazing challenge.</p>

<img class="img-resize" src="me.jpg" width: "100" height: "100" alt= "Me playing a round at White Horse Golf Course in Kingston, WA." >

<p> I grew up playing the public courses in Spokane, WA and the Eagle
Ridge Par 3 course near our residence. When my family moved to
Sammamish, WA and joined the Plateau Club, I was able to play the
game frequently,took a couple lessons and made friends while playing
the course.</p>
